## MVP 0.5 

In the interest of time and maximum efficiency, team ![](http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_scale,h_1080,w_1920/t_mp_quality/mbwu3ekc99viisuad5a5/a-history-of-deadpool-who-are-all-these-side-characters-anyway-798627.jpg) elected to use snippets or design decision of several code bases from past challenges to create our initial skeleteon. We will be using code from Hacker News as our general layout, our take-home self assessment for user login and authentication, craigslist jr. for displaying resources specific to a particular user, comments interface for our jquery and our mock-self assessment for our ajax.

### Clicking on a question will display answers

## MVP 1.0 

For our MVP 1.0, our general design decisions are based on the permissions status of a visitor vs. a logged in user as they pertain to CRUD. A logged in user may navigate the site and perform all four actions of the CRUD design paradigm(Create, Read, Update, Destroy). A visitor's "views" will be identical to that of a logged in user, however, the visitor will be restricted from engaging in any of the CUD's of CRUD. For example, if a visitor clicks on a "delete" or "submit a new question" button, the user will be prompted to log in or register in order to perform the action.

For our 1.0, we want to implement as much AJAX as required for all the above tasks in order to dynamically changed our page without refreshing.
